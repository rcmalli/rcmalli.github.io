I completed my undergraduate degree in electronics and communication engineering at Istanbul Technical University (ITU).</p> <p>During my graduate studies, I have worked on the adversarial robustness of Deep Neural Networks. I have visualized perturbation based adversarial attacks and their effects on neural networks. I have studied specialized training methods for creating robust models. My thesis project was supervised by Marco Ciccone and Prof. Matteo Matteucci.</p> <p>I completed my bachelor's degree with a project for extracting attributes from facial images using convolutional neural networks. I developed edge deep learning applications running on edge devices. The project was supervised by Prof. Hazim Kemal Ekenel.</p>"},{"location":"blog/","title":"Blog Posts","text":"<p>Coming soon...</p>"},{"location":"index-test/","title":"Home","text":"<pre><code>def bubble_sort(items):\n    for i in range(len(items)):\n        for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i):\n            if items[j] &gt; items[j + 1]:\n                items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j]\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"index-test/#equation","title":"Equation","text":"\\[ \\alpha^{\\text {adap }}=\\alpha \\mu^{l} /\\left(1 / L \\sum_{l=1}^{L} \\mu^{l}\\right) \\]"},{"location":"index-test/#pseudocode","title":"Pseudocode","text":"<p>Bold text</p> <pre>\n    % This quicksort algorithm is extracted from Chapter 7, Introduction to Algorithms (3rd edition)\n    \\begin{algorithm}\n    \\caption{Quicksort}\n    \\begin{algorithmic}\n    \\PROCEDURE{Quicksort}{$A, p, r$}\n        \\IF{$p &lt; r$} \n            \\STATE $q = $ \\CALL{Partition}{$A, p, r$}\n            \\STATE \\CALL{Quicksort}{$A, p, q - 1$}\n            \\STATE \\CALL{Quicksort}{$A, q + 1, r$}\n        \\ENDIF\n    \\ENDPROCEDURE\n    \\PROCEDURE{Partition}{$A, p, r$}\n        \\STATE $x = A[r]$\n        \\STATE $i = p - 1$\n        \\FOR{$j = p$ \\TO $r - 1$}\n            \\IF{$A[j] &lt; x$}\n                \\STATE $i = i + 1$\n                \\STATE exchange\n                $A[i]$ with $A[j]$\n            \\ENDIF\n            \\STATE exchange $A[i]$ with $A[r]$\n        \\ENDFOR\n    \\ENDPROCEDURE\n    \\end{algorithmic}\n    \\end{algorithm}\n</pre>"}]}
