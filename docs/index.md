## Profesional Experience

- **(2021 June)** I have joined to Orobix as a Data Scientist. I am currently developing intelligent solutions for visual inspection in the manufacturing industry.

 
## Academic Background

I obtained a Master's degree in computer science engineering at Politecnico di Milano ([Polimi](https://www.polimi.it)). I completed my undergraduate degree in electronics and communication engineering at Istanbul Technical University ([ITU](https://www.itu.edu.tr)).

During my graduate studies, I have worked on the adversarial robustness of Deep Neural Networks. I have visualized perturbation based adversarial attacks and their effects on neural networks. I have studied specialized training methods for creating robust models. My thesis project was supervised by [Marco Ciccone](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hOQjblcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Matteo Matteucci](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PdbEg5YAAAAJ&hl=en).

I completed my bachelor's degree with a project for extracting attributes from facial images using convolutional neural networks. I developed edge deep learning applications running on edge devices. The project was supervised by [Prof. Hazim Kemal Ekenel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LfIDj68AAAAJ&hl=en).
